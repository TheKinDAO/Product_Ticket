Each Product Ticket is a legally binding claim between the **producer** (Work Contract signatory) and the **consumer** (Product Ticket holder) representing the future production of a specific good or service at a projected quality and quantity and delivery date, often as a subscription.

Product Tickets are sold *before* that good or service has been created, usually as a way to fund that production.

Product Tickets are neither Equity nor Debt and do not suggest any financial return.
