Each Product_Ticket represents a future good or service at a projected quality and quantity and delivery date, often as a subscription, held under the terms of the [For Product](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cRYLXIQnNWfXNU88UvxdlKgdLfOyoXSvl4xyp6xytMU/) development model.

Each Product_Ticket may require many associated Work_Contracts as it moves through the supply chain.
P/
The DAO trades Product_Tickets for (usually un-associated) Work_Contracts.  This means you can pay for future apples by picking future oranges.

Product_Tickets are neither Equity nor Debt and do not suggest any financial return.
